    <!-- Core:
    * Create a website about your favourite band using HTML (no css yet)
    * Elements that should be included:
        * A homepage, featuring photo of the band and a brief description
         (How they started, genre, controversy etc)
        * A discography page, showing their latest 3 studio albums
        (in order of release, with an album cover and track listing)
        * A bio page showing an unordered list of band members, with a photo, name, instrument for each
        * A navbar with links to the 3 pages
        * A Heading on each page, telling the user which page they are on.
        * Hompage should have title of the band, with a sub-heading saying 'Tribute Site' or something similar
        * A footer with your copyright (make sure to use the symbol)
        * Your page should validate in this at this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri
        * Keep your code readabable and maintanable for your future self and future contributors. -->


        <!-- Core:
* Update and improve your band tribute site using the skills you've learned so far
* Create a new git branch for the new features
* Create an external stylesheet and link it to the HTML
* Add IDs and classes to elements as needed
 (Remember to limit the use of IDs)
* Choose two Google fonts (one for headings, one for everything else), add them to your site
* Set font colors, background colors and background images where appropriate
* Re-organise your HTML into semantic elements
 (eg. navbar in a nav element, footer in a footer element, etc...)
* Do some more self-learning to get this page looking nice and pretty
* We will hopefully present a few later this afternoon! -->

                <p>
                    Bloc Party are an English rock band, composed of Kele Okereke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, sampler), Russell Lissack (lead guitar, keyboards), Justin Harris (bass guitar, keyboards, saxophones, backing vocals) and Louise Bartle (drums, percussion). Former members Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music. The band was formed at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack. They went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003. Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in NME magazine, while Tong was picked via an audition. Bloc Party got their break by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand's lead singer, Alex Kapranos, a copy of their demo "She's Hearing Voices".

                    In February 2005, the band released their debut album Silent Alarm. It was critically acclaimed and was named Indie Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards and NME Album of the year which both honour indie music. That year, the record was also certified platinum in Britain. The band built on this success in 2007 with the release of their second studio album, A Weekend in the City, which reached a peak of number two in the UK Albums Chart and number twelve in the Billboard 200. In August 2008, Bloc Party released their third studio record, Intimacy which entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight and number eighteen on the Billboard 200. The band went on a hiatus in October 2009 to focus on side projects. They reunited in September 2011, and shortly thereafter released their fourth album, Four, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number three. In 2013, Bloc Party released their third EP titled The Nextwave Sessions in August; the band then began an indefinite hiatus to continue with their respective side projects. The band's fifth studio album, Hymns, the first to involve Harris and Bartle, was released on 29 January 2016. Bloc Party have sold over 3 million albums worldwide.[1]
